# HERSS, AI Researcher 03. 2020 - 06. 2020
• Responsibility: Brain MRI data preprocessing for brain tumor detection(U-Net)  
<details>
<summary> Project : MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation </summary>
<div markdown="1">

    – Achievement: Applied 6 data preprocessing methods(Z-score normalization, whit strip, Ravel etc) to the brain MRI data, but none resulted in a significant improvement in performance.  

    – Insight: When compared to the underlying The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) data Identified that the delivered data was not the original data, leading to the discovery of a problem with the data preprocessing. This helped to identify a major issue with the data and led to improvements in data handling processes at the company.
